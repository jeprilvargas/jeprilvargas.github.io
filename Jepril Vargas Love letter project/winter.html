	A frozen flower
	</h2>
	<br>
It’s been a while since we talked <br> 
Conversations gone low <br>
Buried in the streets I walk<br>
Are memories of summer all buried in the snow <br>
<br>
<br>
If I speak my mind <br>
Would you give me time? <br>
If my poems won't rhyme <br>
Would I still make sense? <br>
<br>
<br>
As I walk the streets <br>
And wound myself in hail <br>
I suddenly thought of you <br>
And how our conversation got stale <br>
<br>
<br>
Temperature drops <br>
Our conversation starts to stop <br>
I’ve been too focused on spring <br>
That I find myself stuck <br>
<br>
<br>
I find myself helpless <br>
As the fog hides your face <br>
I find my words reckless <br>
As love slowly gets replaced <br>
<br>
<br>
Replaced with resentment <br>
And shutting of doors<br>
It’s been a few weeks <br>
And I don’t see you anymore <br> 
<br>
<br>
The snow covered flowers <br> 
All buried in snow <br>
I’ll dig it up all the love I could get <br>
Just to remind you <br>
Just to let you know <br>

I’ll try give you a rose its scarlet it frail <br>
A reminder of love though conversations gone stale <br>
As I walk through the fields <br>
I’ll endure all the hail <br>
<br>
<br>
As I try to lift my feet up <br>
My feet has gone frozen <br>
I’m stuck in the snow <br>
And still no words are spoken<br>
<br>
<br>
Here I was stuck in a cycle I slowly grieved <br>
You could’ve gone anywhere <br>
But a small part of me knew <br>
That you would never leave <br>
<br>
<br>
All my life <br>
My ambitions been my worth <br>
Against all odds you convince me <br>
My ambitions is my curse <br>
